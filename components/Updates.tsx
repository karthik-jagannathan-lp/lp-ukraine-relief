      Hi all,
      </p>
      <p className="text-base">
      I am back in Erie and I have some happy news: today a full 40‚Äô hi-cube container of humanitarian aid worth over $100,000 was loaded and shipped from the Erie Times-News warehouse!
      </p>
      <img src="eri_1_1.jpg" />
      <p className="text-base">
      It will go directly from Erie to New York, then sail to Gdynia. From there it will travel by truck to our our sister-city friends in Lublin, Poland. Our warehouse staff was on hand to watch it leave!
      </p>
      <img src="eri_1_2.jpg" />
      <p className="text-base">
      This donation effort was led by Rep. Bob Merski, and supported by our local Polish clubs as well as other Erieites.  
      </p>
      <img src="eri_1_3.jpg" />
      <p className="text-base">
      We hope this is the first of several containers we will ship to Lublin, to support the over 30,000 Ukrainian refugees now living there.

      Today we made our way to two border crossing points: Korczowa and Medyka.  Words cannot adequately describe what we saw there, but I will try!

      Korczowa is well organized, with an immense refugee center, and buses leaving hourly to multiple cities.  We were ‚Äúescorted‚Äù by special police (Polish FBI) when they saw our cameras but they were very polite and told us all about the center and auxiliary housing tents there.

      Medyka is more chaotic, and the sheer number of volunteers there is incredible: we saw people from Spain, India, Germany, Norway, Israel, Taiwan, USA, Canada, Holland, Austria and Ukraine.

      Hi all,

      <p className="text-base">
      Greetings from Lublin, our sister city in Poland! We traveled here today from Rzeszow to meet with the deputy marshal of the Voivodeship of Lublin (equivalent to our Lt. Governor).
      </p>
      <p className="text-base">
      We received the warmest reception from Marshal Wojciechowski and his staff.

      Inna, our new project manager from Ukraine, me, the Marshal, his staff member Izabel, Rachel of Erie News Now
      </p>
      <p className="text-base">
      They told us about their efforts to help the Ukrainians arriving there, and showed us their office building which has been repurposed into housing and a supplies warehouse. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-base">
      We toured the Lublin Cultural Center which has also made living space for families, and has set up a play center for moms and kids, with books in Ukrainian. But the staff says the language doesn‚Äôt matter - the kids find ways to communicate.
      </p>
      <img src="pol2.jpg"/>
      <p className="text-base">

      The train station has set up a medical center trackside, and used every inch of available office space for accommodations for passengers connecting through Lublin to other points, in Poland and beyond. 
      </p>
      <img src="pol3.jpg"/>
      <img src="pol4.jpg"/>

      We met many volunteers, and every one of them was so excited to be able to help (reminded me so much of LP!). There were many tears as they described what they have seen, mixed with smiles as they told us with pride of their contributions. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-base">
      The Marshal got very emotional (I did too!) when thanking Erie for all our efforts, and reminded us that more is needed!

      LP Ukraine has been supported by multiple LP offices worldwide, with everything from cash donations to personal assistance at the borders.  Today we would like to give a big shoutout to our LP Germany partner, Carl Polzin.

    Our mayor, Joe Schember, (in the above photo) pointed up to his office on the fourth floor of City Hall.  He held up a Ukrainian flag, and told everyone that he would put it in his office window until this crisis is over.  He asked me to send his best wishes to all of our LP Ukraine team members!

    There were songs and hymns.  There were passionate speeches and beautiful prayers.

    One of the speakers told a favorite story of mine, about a little girl picking up starfish from the beach and throwing them back into the ocean so they would not die.  A man watching her said, ‚Äúwhy are you doing that?  Can‚Äôt you see there are thousands of starfish on the beach?  You can‚Äôt save all of them.‚Äù  The little girl picked up another starfish, threw it into the ocean and said, ‚Äúmaybe not, but I just saved that one!‚Äù  Please don‚Äôt stop praying and donating to our friends.  All of our small efforts will add up to a big impact.  Ukraine may be far away, but the Ukrainian people are right here in our hearts!

    There was no report yesterday, as we have been busy with coordination efforts.  Going forward, I will report periodically if not daily.

    We continue to report good news:  the young woman we mentioned on Wednesday crossed the border safely and is now in Rseszow, in an apartment with her mom and her dog, Archibald.  They are resting today after their long journey.  The first three teammates who crossed last weekend are settling into their new apartment, and are already cooking Ukrainian specialties for their Polish hosts!

    A big shout out to Moustafa Elhadary and Brendan Burbules, who created our fundraising page in a matter of hours over last weekend. From Moustafa:
    ‚ÄúJim sent me an email Saturday Feb 26 around noon asking if we can setup a website to collect funds.  I looked into it with Brendan and for various reasons realized the only way to do it was to code and build a site from scratch.  So I started coding around 8PM and by 3:43AM the site was live and ready to go.  At 4:23AM Sunday morning Jim sent out the email to everyone and funds instantaneously started coming through‚Äù.  All in a day‚Äôs (or night‚Äôs!) work for our amazing IT professionals.  Thank you both!

    Donations continue to come in, including $10,000 from some friends in Erie, and $25,000 from one of LP‚Äôs larger customers, raising the total to nearly $575,000. In all, there have been over 250 individual donations so far, and they are making a tremendous difference. Thank you!

    I have received many kind emails thanking me for these reports, but as I tell everyone, I am only the messenger.  We have a whole team dedicated to this effort, working long hours on their own time to help out.  I would like to recognize this core team, which also has lots of support from other LP folks both here in HQ and from all over the world:
    </p>
    <p className="text-base">
    Emile Zafirov (from Bulgaria) is our CIO, living in North Carolina; Heiko Mueller is MD of our Germany office. Ivan Nemeth (from Hungary), Jim Berlin (our CEO), Julie Slomski, Maria Czerwinski, Tracy Coffy and I are all in Erie; Michal Smid (from Czech Republic) worked for us in Erie and now does so from CZ; Pawel Wronski manages our Rzeszow, Poland office.  We all are working to support Volodymyr (Vova) Bohovych and his team in our Ukraine office in Ivano-Frankivsk. 
    </p>
    <p className="text-base">
    There are also three people on the team who are NOT LP employees but we wish they were:  Zsigmond Balla, president and CEO of Ziglift, is from Hungary but living in the US, and is well-connected to many resources all over Europe; Ola Sieradzka from Poland was an intern in our Erie office (at the age of 16!) and has been a dear friend ever since.  She has done an enormous amount of travel and coordination for the first groups arriving in Poland.  Thank you, Ola!
    </p>
    <p className="text-base">
    But to help Ola get back to her ‚Äúday job‚Äù at HSBC we have just acquired our newest team member, Ola‚Äôs BEST friend Inna Zaripova, who is a Ukraine native currently living in Boise, Idaho.  Inna speaks Ukrainian, Russian, German, Polish and English, and will be of great help to us in communicating with our travelers and their helpers along the way.  
    </p>
    <p className="text-base">
    It has been amazing to see the creativity and selfless acts that have come out of this team effort.  We can‚Äôt say it enough:  thank you!
    </p>
    <p className="text-base">
    Slava Ukrayini!

    Hi all,

    <p className="text-base">
    It‚Äôs been a great week so far.  I have been brushing up on my eastern European geography and spellings of place names! üòä  For you Google Maps geeks, our next group (one LP Ukraine employee, her mom and a dog) are currently 100 km from the Ukraine/Poland border at Korczowa-Kracovets.  From there they will go to Rzeszow, Poland, where the amazing Pawel has miraculously secured an apartment, as he says, by ‚Äúpure luck‚Äù, as thousands of people are coming into the city, and everyone is looking for housing!
    </p>
    <p className="text-base">
    Thank you to LP Germany, for organizing a truckload of relief supplies with the help of one of their clients.  It will likely be sent to Romania to be distributed to Ukrainian refugees arriving there.
    </p>
    <p className="text-base">
    And thanks to everyone who is passing along the donation website info.  We continue to receive funds from all over the world, and we promise to be good stewards of this money.
